        <h1>Sustainably Made</h1>
        <p>Sustainably Made is a UX Design project that was created from the prompt "Design an app that helps reduce users'
            carbon footprints". Working in a group of four students, I began by conducting UX research to better understand
            what gaps existed in the sustainable tech market, what kind of people were interested in sustainable tech,
            and what kinds of products I could create to fulfill those user's needs.</p>
        <br>
        <p>My research led to a key insight that consumers would choose a sustainable option if it was presented to them,
            but wouldn't go out of their way to find a sustainable option. As one interviewee stated, "convenience is king".</p>
        <br>
        <p>Using this insight I came up with the idea for a platform that would only present local sustainable business
            options to the user. Here users could review, save, and favorite local businesses to visit over and over again
            and reduce their carbon footprints over time. Only presenting sustainable options relieved users of having to
            do their own tedious research on the business's sustainability, and presented them with options that they could
            trust were sustainable. We built user trust by ranking each business bronze, silver, or gold in sustainability,
            clearly clarifying to the user what practices qualify for which sustainability medal, and highlighting each
            business's sustainable practices.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The development process was conducted using Agile methodology. After the completion of one prototype iteration,
            our team conducted user testing, reviewed feedback, made changes to not only the app's features but also the
            strategies in which we approached our goal to reduce users' carbon footprints. We continued testing until we
            had a functioning high-fidelity prototype that users loved and found easy to use.</p>
