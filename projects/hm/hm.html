        <h1>Rediscover Your Roots</h1>
        <p>"Rediscover Your Roots" is an advertising campaign for the global fashion brand H&M, created as a final
            project for Introduction to Advertising. In this project I worked with a group of four students to analyze
            H&M's current standing in the fashion industry, create advertising objectives based on our findings, and
            execute the creative deliverables using Adobe InDesign.</p>
        <br>
        <p>In this project I used research skills to conduct a SWOT analysis on H&M and used consumer insights to accurately
            assess the brand's public perception. Making data-driven decisions to shape our advertising objectives, our
            team strategized ways that our campaign could address H&M's pitfalls of being an untrustworthy fast-fashion brand
            while playing upon its strengths of being affordable, trendy, and internationally recognized.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Our strategy was to create a cohesive and authentic brand identity for H&M to account for its past scandals
            involving brand dishonesty. This led us to "Reconnect with Your Roots", an ad campaign that pays homage to
            H&M's humble origins as a Swedish brand from the city of Västerås. It also appealed to the popular fashion
            trend "cottage core", which was a trending fashion movement with high engagement across Gen Z and Millennial
            social media platforms such as TikTok, thereby targeting H&M's main consumers. In addition to contributing to
            the group's research, I was tasked with creating the billboard and social media visuals, which I executed using
            Adobe InDesign.</p>
