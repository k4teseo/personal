            <p><strong><i>Hi, I'm Kate Seo,</i></strong> I'm a rising junior at Boston University studying computer science with
                a minor in innovation & entrepreneurship. Originally from New York, I bring creativity and a diverse perspective
                 to all things product, design, and engineering. I'm passionate about tech because it allows people of all
                backgrounds to express their creativity and build their unique vision. In the future I hope to work as a product manager,
                software engineer, or UX designer at a company that works to make tech accessible to all. At university I serve
                 as the marketing director for Hack4Impact, a nationwide non-profit that creates social good through building
                projects for non-profits. I am also the project manager of community at Spark!, where I work to create a fun and
                inclusive environment for an organization of 200+ diverse students in tech. Outside of school I love to travel and
                 am studying abroad in London this upcoming semester. I'm always interested in learning about new people and cultures
                and am teaching myself Chinese in my free time.</p>
